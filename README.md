# Cross Country Inflation Calculator

Summary: What is the website, relation to connected environments. 1-2 sentences.

# Research Question

**Why would we want to compare inflation across countries?**

* reason 2 why co2 might be **higher** when inflation is higher

* reason 1 why co2 might be **lower** when inflation is higher
* reason 2 why co2 might be **lower** when inflation is higher
