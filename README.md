# üí´ About Us:
We currently working on a web development project that <br>looks at the relationship between inflation and CO2 emissions.<br>We are have just completed our Connected Environments module; Casa-0017<br><br><br>Fun fact: Why do we put candles on top of birthday cakes?<br>Some believe that the tradition of birthday candles began <br>in Ancient Greece, when people brought cakes adorned with <br>lit candles to the temple of Artemis, goddess of the hunt. The candles were lit to make them glow like the moon, <br>a popular symbol associated with Artemis.

# Cross Country Inflation Calculator

Summary: What is the website, relation to connected environments. 1-2 sentences.
Our Cross Country Carbon and Inflation Calculator is simple tool allowing the users to understand how much ¬£X in year Y is worth in a given year. CCCIC took this concept and adapted it to allow users to interact with multi-country data, i.e. compare how much ¬£X in year Y is worth in a given year across multiple countries.  

Initially, our research question was shaped by the desire to understand how purchasing power had evolved over time in GB, FR, DE, and IT, with a focus on comparing these countries. The primary audience for this inquiry was investors seeking insights into the impact of inflation across different nations. 

# Research Question

How has the purchasing power changed over time in GB, FR, DE and IT and how do these countries compare?‚Äã Has purchasing power been correctalted with carbon emissions in the same year?

**Why compare inflation across countries & technologies used**
We observed that national emissions data primarily relies on estimations using accounting tools and assumptions, rather than directly sensing the environment. This realisation led to the formation of the phase 2 of the project, which aims to establish a connection between human activity (inflation) and measured CO2 presence in the environment. The phase 2  research question therefore is: 
‚ÄúHow do purchasing power and CO2 presence correlate over time in GB, FR, DE, and IT, and how do these countries compare?‚Äù  
* üöÄ Checking inflation rates in different countries helps you see how well each country is doing economically and whether it's a good place to invest or travel. ‚Äã

* üöÄ Historical data helps us see how economies have grown or struggled in the past. ‚Äã

*üöÄ For those who travel or invest money, it gives insights into the safety, growth potential and CO@ reduction strategies of differing countries. ‚Äã

*üöÄLearning from the past helps us make better decision.

**Why could inflation correlate with CO2 emissions in the same year?**

* reason 1 why co2 might be **higher** when inflation is higher
* reason 2 why co2 might be **higher** when inflation is higher

* reason 1 why co2 might be **lower** when inflation is higher
* reason 2 why co2 might be **lower** when inflation is higher


# Project Inspiration

The inspiration for the inflation calculator tool came from the historical UK inflation rates and price conversion calculator (iamkate, n.d.).
