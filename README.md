# Cross Country Inflation Calculator

Summary: What is the website, relation to connected environments. 1-2 sentences.
Our Cross Country Carbon and Inflation Calculator is simple tool allowing the users to understand how much ¬£X in year Y is worth in a given year. CCCIC took this concept and adapted it to allow users to interact with multi-country data, i.e. compare how much ¬£X in year Y is worth in a given year across multiple countries.  

Initially, our research question was shaped by the desire to understand how purchasing power had evolved over time in GB, FR, DE, and IT, with a focus on comparing these countries. The primary audience for this inquiry was investors seeking insights into the impact of inflation across different nations. 

# Research Question

How has the purchasing power changed over time in GB, FR, DE and IT and how do these countries compare?‚Äã Has purchasing power been correctalted with carbon emissions in the same year?

**Why compare inflation across countries & technologies used**
We observed that national emissions data primarily relies on estimations using accounting tools and assumptions, rather than directly sensing the environment. This realisation led to the formation of the phase 2 of the project, which aims to establish a connection between human activity (inflation) and measured CO2 presence in the environment. The phase 2  research question therefore is: 
‚ÄúHow do purchasing power and CO2 presence correlate over time in GB, FR, DE, and IT, and how do these countries compare?‚Äù  
*üöÄ Checking inflation rates in different countries helps you see how well each country is doing economically and whether it's a good place to invest or travel. ‚Äã

*üöÄ Historical data helps us see how economies have grown or struggled in the past. ‚Äã

*üöÄ For those who travel or invest money, it gives insights into the safety, growth potential and CO@ reduction strategies of differing countries. ‚Äã

*üöÄLearning from the past helps us make better decision.

**Why could inflation correlate with CO2 emissions in the same year?**

* reason 1 why co2 might be **higher** when inflation is higher
* reason 2 why co2 might be **higher** when inflation is higher

* reason 1 why co2 might be **lower** when inflation is higher
* reason 2 why co2 might be **lower** when inflation is higher


# Project Inspiration

The inspiration for the inflation calculator tool came from the historical UK inflation rates and price conversion calculator (iamkate, n.d.).

# Approach to team work and project management
During the in-person workshop on the 15th of October we sketched the website, broken down the architecture into 4 key parts and divided responsibilities/ownership:

## Front End overview

The main focus of the front end development was to enable the user to engage with an interface that provides more depth while maintaining a minimalist aesthetic, in turn providing an intuitive experience. This keeps in line with our website's core message, delivering imagery of how growth and inflation through time have a subsequential effect on our environment in a more digestible format that evokes awareness.  


![ux principles](https://github.com/CASA-girls/InflationCalculator/assets/114082509/c5aaeaf9-bf14-4a06-913a-e2da0ec83227)



In the initial stages of creating the storyboard, we initially employed SASS/JavaScript packages as references (Themesberg, n.d.). While the UX user design seemed promising for conceptualising the website, facilitating the seamless addition of website elements by all team members and smooth integration posed a challenge. This limitation in flexibility led to the decision to opt for UI design, utilising the pre-built Bootswatch/CSS framework for formatting instead.  

The main goal for choosing the right UI design was to portray a modern computational aesthetic using neumorphic design, instead of using contrasting darker neon colours and more pronounced pastel colours to aid the visibility of users and those with vision impairments, providing more depth to the website, whilst attracting the attention and guiding the user when exploring interactive graphs and key snippets of information. This is one of the key features for accessible design good practice (Vo, 2020).  



## Back End overview
VS Code Chart Creation Workflow: 

Our workflow encompassed several key steps to ensure a smooth and effective chart creation process: 

Research: Chart library selection (Apache ECharts). The bar chart was chosen for exchange rates, and the line chart was chosen for carbon dioxide emissions. 

Pulling the data from MySQL: The initial phase involved connecting MySQL to VS Code using the MySQL extension. This included downloading the MySQL extension, securely logging into the established group database (password securing steps explained in the following section), and importing data into the charts. 

Connecting Frontend and Backend / establishing an API: The final step in the data visualization process involved connecting the charts and web pages to the backend server. A node.js API was built, leveraging Express to facilitate smooth interaction between the frontend and backend. Express framework was installed using the npm package manager with the command 'npm install express ‚Äìsave.' Express is a highly flexible and high-performance Node.js framework designed for efficiently building web applications and APIs. The inspiration was taken from the CSND blog post (blog.csdn.net, 2023). 

Plotting the charts: The process involved creating a chart container, initialising the chart, configuring it and binding with the data. A folder and an HTML file named "Graphpage.html" were created on VS Code. ECharts was installed using the terminal command "npm install echarts," and the chart's setup involved creating a folder named "node_modules." Subsequently, the "echarts.js" file was located, copied from its original folder and seamlessly incorporated it into the HTML file at the correct file path, along with JQuery. Within the HTML, a container was established to define and fine-tune the chart's size. The ECharts instance was then initialised, and data arrays for inflation and years were defined. This marked the completion of all content creation and setup. Additionally, a variable named "data" was employed to define four data arrays for inflation data (Y-axis for each country) and another data array for storing year data.

# Future improvements to the website

The idea of connected environments is a fundamental element of our website's design focus, looking at a seamless and 3D element that provides depth to a topic. It shows an understanding that sustainable investments fall within a larger global framework, particularly one that focuses on the transition to net zero. We created an engaging platform depicting a website that offers more than a simple calculator but one of perspective and a holistic approach to addressing investment and sustainability.  

The final feature of the phase one prototype is a news feed on the transition to net zero related topics and macro trends driving inflation across countries of interest.
