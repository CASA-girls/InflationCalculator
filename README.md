# üí´ About Us:
Cross Country Carbon Inflation Calculator (CCCIC) is a unique platform providing users with historical inflation and carbon data from four major European countries: Great Britain (GB), France (FR), Germany (DE), and Italy (IT). The website aims to offer insights into the economic performance of these nations, emphasising their commitment to sustainability, particularly in reducing carbon emissions. Assessing a country's carbon emissions becomes integral to aligning investments with long-term sustainability goals.

At its current development stage, CCCIC enables users to interact with historical inflation and CO2 data based on national accounting. Users can compare how purchasing power has changed over time in GB, FR, DE, and IT and correlate these trends with carbon emission patterns. However, the transition to net zero and ongoing transformation of traditionally carbon-intensive industries, such as the steel sector experimenting with green hydrogen, signals a shift towards greener production methods that are not yet standardised across countries, industries, or companies. Conventional accounting systems struggle to accommodate this change, rendering traditional data acquisition methodologies incapable of accurately reflecting reality.

The future phase of CCCIC (roll-out TBC) will bridge this gap by introducing a connected environment study enabled by the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The existing accounting systems therefore struggle to accommodate this change, rendering conventional data acquisition methodologies incapable of accurately reflecting reality.

# üí´ Introduction to the topic

As the transition to net zero is unfolding in the UK and across Europe at full speed, there is a shift to invest sustainably. This shift is in part fuelled by a heightened awareness of the repercussions of carbon intensity to our planet and human life (Halady and Rao, 2010). However, the attractiveness of low carbon investments is also linked to diminished long-term economic risks, attributable to rising carbon pricing and stringent regulations. 

The hypothesis within the scientific community and some investors is that as countries continue to decarbonise, national carbon emissions will increasingly correlate with higher inflation and lower investment returns (Moessner, 2022). However, there is a notable absence of easily accessible online tools enabling investors and other interested parties to comprehensively analyse this unfolding relationship. To address this gap, the Cross Country Carbon and Inflation Calculator (‚ÄúCCCIC‚Äù) tool emerges as a valuable resource. 

Due to time and resource constraints the CCCIC tool will be rolled out in two phases. The first phase is utilising historical time-series and location based data and focuses on allowing the user examine and compare inflation and CO2 data among Great Britain, Germany, Italy and France since 1960. All this data is human collected and mathematical/accounting tools are used to make sense of it. 

The second phase is exploring an introduction of an innovative sensed data layer, made possible by adopting Internet of Things (IoT) architecture and technologies to connect human behaviour (i.e. economic activity) with the environment (Hudson-Smith et al.). This addition is relevant because the transformation of traditionally carbon-intensive industries, such as the steel sector experimenting with green hydrogen (ING, n.d.),  signifies a shift towards greener production methods that are yet not customised across countries, industries nor companies. The existing accounting systems struggle to accommodate this change, rendering conventional data acquisition methodologies incapable of accurately reflecting reality. 


# üí´ Project Inspiration

The inspiration for the inflation calculator tool came from the historical UK inflation rates and price conversion calculator (iamkate, n.d.).  


<img width="387" alt="Picture 1" src="https://github.com/CASA-girls/InflationCalculator/assets/114082509/6d4139f1-6214-45e2-aa6c-ef6b8b822980">

*Figure 1: Historical UK inflation rates and price conversion calculator (iamkate, n.d.)*


It is a simple tool allowing the users to understand how much ¬£X in year Y is worth in a given year. CCCIC took this concept and adapted it to allow users to interact with multi-country data, i.e. compare how much ¬£X in year Y is worth in a given year across multiple countries. 

Initially, our research question was shaped by the desire to understand how purchasing power had evolved over time in GB, FR, DE, and IT, with a focus on comparing these countries. The primary audience for this inquiry was investors seeking insights into the impact of inflation across different nations.

As we delved deeper, contemplating the potential benefits of connected environments, especially in the context of the net-zero transition discussed in the introduction, prompted us to integrate inflation data with CO2 emissions. Consequently, our research question underwent a transformation:

*‚ÄúHow have purchasing power and CO2 emissions reporting changed over time in GB, FR, DE, and IT, and how do these countries compare?‚Äù*

However, during our research, we observed that national emissions data primarily relies on estimations using accounting tools and assumptions, rather than directly sensing the environment. This realisation led to the formation of the phase 2 of the project, which aims to establish a connection between human activity (inflation) and measured CO2 presence in the environment. The phase 2  research question therefore is: 

*‚ÄúHow do purchasing power and CO2 presence correlate over time in GB, FR, DE, and IT, and how do these countries compare?‚Äù*



# Approach to team work and project management
During the in-person workshop on the 15th of October we sketched the website, broken down the architecture into 4 key parts and divided responsibilities/ownership: 

<img width="452" alt="Workflow" src="https://github.com/CASA-girls/InflationCalculator/assets/114082509/4b402db4-86cb-4b87-a3ce-78bacbc8ec35">

We have also agreed on the milestones and key dates such as next review workshop and submission deadline.

<img width="452" alt="timeline" src="https://github.com/CASA-girls/InflationCalculator/assets/114082509/acfd6bfc-42c0-4412-abc1-afeadaf1b252">

Finally, we agreed on a set of tools that would help us get programming tips (Chinese Software development Network or CSDN), sketch website design (Canva, Figma/Wire Frame) and track tasks which each group member is working on (GitHub Project Manager).






#  üí´ Design Development Journey for Phase 1

## Design, storyboarding and outline of the website

First of all we worked on the sketching of the website. During the in person workshop 1 we drew paper sketches to agree on a common goal/look of the website and agreed on functionalities such as buttons, user interaction, input and output boxes, storyline and visualisations of the data. We then transferred the sketch into a power point which helped us to  get a feel for the outcome. 

Sarah then as our UI lead transferred the agreed look and functionalities into Figma (Appendix 1) and finally chose the UI framework that can cater for the website‚Äôs needs, project timelines and the agreed overall design.

Using wireframes and storyboards aided our visualisation of how our website should be navigated and used, especially in considering the logical flow and narrative. Creating wireframes and storyboards facilitated the planning and job division allowing us to visualise the final product in a common way. This allowed us to focus on more challenging aspects of the project within the given timeframe.

These several mock-ups created using PowerPoint and then Figma helped to achieve a clearer pathway to achieving the end result.

<img width="452" alt="design timeline" src="https://github.com/CASA-girls/InflationCalculator/assets/114082509/27e1c245-5c40-4a00-a486-16d8356109bf">

**Design choices, principles and implementation**

The main focus of the front end development was to enable the user to engage with an interface that provides more depth while maintaining a minimalist aesthetic, in turn providing an intuitive experience. This keeps in line with our website's core message, delivering imagery of how growth and inflation through time have a subsequential effect on our environment in a more digestible format that evokes awareness. 

In the initial stages of creating the storyboard, we initially employed SASS/JavaScript packages as references (Themesberg, n.d.). While the UX user design seemed promising for conceptualising the website, facilitating the seamless addition of website elements by all team members and smooth integration posed a challenge. This limitation in flexibility led to the decision to opt for UI design, utilising the pre-built Bootswatch/CSS framework for formatting instead. 

The main goal for choosing the right UI design was to portray a modern computational aesthetic using neumorphic design, instead of using contrasting darker neon colours and more pronounced pastel colours to aid the visibility of users and those with vision impairments, providing more depth to the website, whilst attracting the attention and guiding the user when exploring interactive graphs and key snippets of information. This is one of the key features for accessible design good practice (Vo, 2020). 

The background was to also correlate that there was more depth to the imagery than the standard web calculators as for example our inspiration Historical UK inflation rates and price conversion calculator website (iamkate, n.d.). Our goal was to establish an immersive experience, offering greater potential for expansion with live and intricate data sets. The typography used is clear, simple, and contrasting to benefit the visibility of the user, a juxtaposition to the more interactive features of the website as it is a widely accepted good practice (Webflow, n.d.).

![ux principles](https://github.com/CASA-girls/InflationCalculator/assets/114082509/c5aaeaf9-bf14-4a06-913a-e2da0ec83227)

Using Bootswatch and Bootstrap helped to set the theme which is a consistent modern look in the design process, with features such as buttons, navbars, and input and output boxes that mimic real life buttons and have 3D features. This is one of the key elements of neumorphic design (Anon, n.d.). These frameworks were shared among the other group members so they could familiarise themselves with the design theme and incorporate their own elements into it. Bootswatch also allowed for the website to remain consistent across different browsers, allowing users to engage with the website's core message. These scripts were more reliable and responsive and had a lot more documentation to support front-end development. 

At first we were presented with resizing issues when adapting to different screen sizes. However, we wanted to ensure that design allows dynamic adjustment as the web page size is adjusting, hence we as a team worked on figuring out the hierarchy of the elements and how Bootstrap/CSS formatting works. We ensured that key elements were sized in % terms in relation to their parent and children elements rather than fixed size in pixels and also used padding, which allowed us to achieve the aforementioned goal.



## Backend Development

**Data collection, handling, cleaning and management of dataset**

For the first phase of our project, our primary focus was on gathering historical Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data spanning from 1960 for Great Britain, Germany, Italy, and France. The CPI inflation data was sourced from the MacroTrends website (MacroTrends, n.d.), while the CO2 data was obtained from the Our World in Data website (Our World in Data, n.d.). Combining these datasets, we created a comprehensive Excel file, which was subsequently uploaded to the MySQL server's database named "ucqbutk@casa0017.cetools.org" under the table Inflation Calculator.

<img width="461" alt="tools " src="https://github.com/CASA-girls/InflationCalculator/assets/114082509/950acaa7-d5dd-41b6-9104-b8230b830152">


The chosen architecture streamlined the data collection process, allowing us to efficiently pull the data into Visual Studio Code (VS Code). This facilitated seamless data analysis and the implementation of calculations to enhance user interaction with the Cross Country Carbon and Inflation Calculator (CCCIC) tool. This approach was deemed the most practical and straightforward, enabling us to achieve our desired outcomes within the defined project constraints.


**Interactive calculator feature**

The idea of our calculator feature can be traced back to a simple currency converter published on the I am Kate blog (iamkate, n.d.), demonstrating the value of ¬£ in a selected year compared to another. We expanded this idea to enable users to input ¬£ values in a given year and observe their worth in another year across four studied countries: Great Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. To facilitate cross-country comparison without the need for currency conversion, we standardised the input currency to pounds.

The calculation employs a multiplier, determining the percentage change in currency value from one year to another. Each country has specific multipliers for different years, and as users input selected ¬£ values and choose years, the website calculates using the following formula:

![image](https://github.com/CASA-girls/InflationCalculator/assets/85103939/263d5f38-c89c-4f95-b7c7-d88484176e71)

Where "a" represents the target year, "b" represents the base year, and "Input Amount" stands for the user-defined amount. All the mentioned values are inputs.

For instance, to determine the value of ¬£100 in the UK in 1970, considering it was ¬£100 in 1964, the specific formula is as follows:

![image](https://github.com/CASA-girls/InflationCalculator/assets/85103939/a0df4508-a07a-416a-97df-f79b4301dffd)


The calculator performs the same calculation in the backend for other countries and displays the results in the corresponding output boxes.

To retrieve multipliers from the database, we implemented a function named 'calculateInflation,' which facilitates AJAX requests for data retrieval and subsequent calculations. The idea was taken from a blog post  ‚ÄúThe Backend servers implements the MySQL Database Operation Interface‚Äù published on the China Software Developer Network (CSDN, 2023). AJAX requests using jQuery fetch data from the backend, and the results are presented on the webpage. For visual intuitiveness, outputs for each country are displayed in a bubble format on a map. Currently, a map image serves as a placeholder, but efforts are underway to replace it with a user-friendly and interactive map, such as Google Maps or ARC GIS. This enhancement becomes particularly relevant as the database expands to include all countries and regions globally, allowing users to zoom in and out to areas of interest and filter the displayed countries based on their preferences.


**Data visualisation in graph**

Currently the data is visualised using historical graphs only. We have one graph ‚ÄúHistorical CPI inflation graph‚Äù showing how much ¬£100 (GBP) was worth in every year since 1960s in GB, DE, IT and FR and another graph ‚Äúhistorical CO2 emissions graph‚Äù showing average national CO2 emissions per year based on the national accounting. These graphs are static and act as a placeholder for interactive graphs that would be taking the user input from the calculator tool and plotting the country specific values in a chart. The emissions graph also currently displays CO2 emissions across years in all countries but we are working to also link it to the user choices and inputs used in the calculator to help the user make inferences by looking at inflation and co2 emissions.

Following thorough research on various data visualisation libraries like D3.js, Highcharts.com, and Apache ECharts, the choice was made to utilise Apache ECharts (Echarts, n.d.) as the framework for our website. This powerful charting and visualisation library for JavaScript emerged as the most suitable option.

Versatility and flexibility of Apache ECharts played a crucial role in our decision-making. It offered a range of chart types, and we specifically leveraged its capabilities for creating bar charts to effectively illustrate currency exchange rates and line charts for visualising carbon dioxide emissions trends. The library's capacity to handle large datasets and its responsiveness were pivotal factors, ensuring that our users can interact with the charts smoothly and explore the data effortlessly.


VS Code Chart Creation Workflow:
Our workflow encompassed several key steps to ensure a smooth and effective chart creation process:
üöÄ  **Research: Chart library selection (Apache ECharts):**
  - The bar chart was chosen for exchange rates.
  - The line chart was chosen for carbon dioxide emissions.

üöÄ  **Pulling the data from MySQL:**

**News Feed section**

The idea of connected environments is a fundamental element of our website's design focus, looking at a seamless and 3D element that provides depth to a topic. It shows an understanding that sustainable investments fall within a larger global framework, particularly one that focuses on the transition to net zero. We created an engaging platform depicting a website that offers more than a simple calculator but one of perspective and a holistic approach to addressing investment and sustainability. 

The final feature of the phase one prototype is a news feed on the transition to net zero related topics and macro trends driving inflation across countries of interest.

Each card would require an identifier using Document Object Model(DOM) to display a news article in the place holder tiles. Using JavaScript to create the news cards and JSON to fetch the data from the News API key and filter the code parameters to sort our results into economic and environmental using the function update and fetch.

 The front-end integration for visualising CO2 emissions would use three.js again using a JavaScript library to view the data also ensuring the front UI code doesn‚Äôt prevent the data from being shown, the same scenario encountered with the map and calculator.
 
The backend would be retrieving data using these two APIs:
  - NewsAPI (News API, n.d.) (JSON).
  - OpenAQ API (api.openaq.org, n.d.).

## Back End overview
VS Code Chart Creation Workflow: 

Our workflow encompassed several key steps to ensure a smooth and effective chart creation process: 

Research: Chart library selection (Apache ECharts). The bar chart was chosen for exchange rates, and the line chart was chosen for carbon dioxide emissions. 

Pulling the data from MySQL: The initial phase involved connecting MySQL to VS Code using the MySQL extension. This included downloading the MySQL extension, securely logging into the established group database (password securing steps explained in the following section), and importing data into the charts. 

Connecting Frontend and Backend / establishing an API: The final step in the data visualization process involved connecting the charts and web pages to the backend server. A node.js API was built, leveraging Express to facilitate smooth interaction between the frontend and backend. Express framework was installed using the npm package manager with the command 'npm install express ‚Äìsave.' Express is a highly flexible and high-performance Node.js framework designed for efficiently building web applications and APIs. The inspiration was taken from the CSND blog post (blog.csdn.net, 2023). 

Plotting the charts: The process involved creating a chart container, initialising the chart, configuring it and binding with the data. A folder and an HTML file named "Graphpage.html" were created on VS Code. ECharts was installed using the terminal command "npm install echarts," and the chart's setup involved creating a folder named "node_modules." Subsequently, the "echarts.js" file was located, copied from its original folder and seamlessly incorporated it into the HTML file at the correct file path, along with JQuery. Within the HTML, a container was established to define and fine-tune the chart's size. The ECharts instance was then initialised, and data arrays for inflation and years were defined. This marked the completion of all content creation and setup. Additionally, a variable named "data" was employed to define four data arrays for inflation data (Y-axis for each country) and another data array for storing year data.
